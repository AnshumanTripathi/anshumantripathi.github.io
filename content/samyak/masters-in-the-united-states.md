# Challenges faced by an Indian Student pursuing Master's Degree in the United States

## Difference in Education systems
* It can take time to get accustomed to the education system in the US if you are coming from a country like India.
* Rules regarding plagiarism are extremely strict.
* The course work is very rigorous and involves a lot of practical application which can suddenly feel daunting.
* You are required to maintain a certain GPA (>3.0) to main your F-1 student visa status. This is means it's not enough to just get a passing grade, instead you need to get a B or above in all your courses.
* A same course can have entirely different coursework based on who is teaching it.

## Cultural differences
* The cultural shock is one of the biggest hurdles when moving to the United States. 
* You are suddenly surrounded by people from all around the world.
* Festivals are suddenly smaller and different.
* Coming from a country like India, you get used to being around family if worse comes to worst. You might not have that anymore in a foreign country.

## Personal Finances
* You suddenly become responsible for all of your home finances, education fees, etc. which can be big step.
* Once anyone goes to the United States you realize how expensive everything is. You are spending in Dollars on everything and converting it back to your home currency. It takes a while to stop doing this.

## Sudden increase of paperwork
* You might realize that now you are filing and maintain a ton documents (I-20s, I-94s, I-797As, I-140, etc.).
* You are now responsible for your own taxes.

## Medical assistance
* In countries like the United States, where medical assistance and medicine is expensive, it is extremely important to have some health insurance.
* A health insurance can be provided by your school or employer, or you can enroll yourself into a health insurance policy.
* Medicines and checkups can be expensive. It's always advisable to get off the shelf medicines from your home country.
* Not all medicines are available freely. You need to a doctor's prescription for a lot of medicines.

## Returning home whenever you want is not possible anymore
* Since you are literally on the other side of the world, it's not possible to just rush back home even in the case of emergencies.
* Sometimes even when you can afford the ticket, things like Visa restrictions can become a problem for returning home.
* You suddenly realize that you are missing big events like weddings since most people only go home once a year.

# What does this all mean?
Pursing your master's degree in the United States can be very rewarding, but it comes with its own set of challenges. Before making this decision think really hard to follow down this path. 
Also, it is often said that people do not permanently come back once they leave. This is not exactly right. People go countries like the United States to pursue a better life which is completely subjective. **A lot of people feel they have a better life back in their home country which is why they go back to their home countries while others don't.**
Make sure you consider all of this before taking the step of pursing masters in a foreign country.
