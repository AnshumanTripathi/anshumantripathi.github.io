# Choosing the sciences
When I was in high school I was often asked by teachers what I wanted to do when I grew up. Since I never gave an inch of thought about this topic I would say something that my friends used to say like I wanted to be a Doctor or an Engineer or something like that.
As years passed I started to realize that it was time I give a serious thought on what I wanted to be when I grew up. In 10th grade I we realized this we were on a turning point as after the 10th grade we were given a choice of streams like arts, commerce and sciences. This is the first fork in the road every Indian student faces for their careers.
Since my inclination had always been towards science I took the path of choosing the sciences. 

Even with the science there are three options:
1. Physics + Chemistry + Mathematics + Electives (PCM)
2. Physics + Chemistry + Biology + Electives (PCB)
3. Physics + Chemistry + Biology + Mathematics + Electives (PCBM)

To be honest, I was not the top student in my class so #3 was out of the question. I used to get good grades Biology and I could find my way around with Mathematics. I was told by teachers that the Biology track is a difficult one for the career, and it takes years to start a career so the only choice left for me was the PCM route. Until now I never had a serious thought about my future, and I was just going where the tide took me. In the end the road I took was not because I had a plan but more because I thought I can survive this get somehow get passing grades. 
When I looked at my classmates around me, it was a much different picture. It seemed like they had a plan when they took path and they knew (atleast to some extent) what their future had in store for them which made sometimes made me think if I made a mistake of not thinking about this more seriously.

The point I want to emphasize here is that I was just 15 at that time and everytime someone asked me about what I wanted to do in the future everyone always made me realize that whatever I select now will set my career path in stone. Nobody every told me that you are still young and you can always change switch paths in the future. To an extent they were right for atleast in India, its almost unheard of that somebody took the PCM route and then ended up becoming a doctor or even a commerce student becoming an engineer.
Regardless I ended up on a route to become an engineer of sorts but I soon realized it had nothing to do with either P, C or M.
