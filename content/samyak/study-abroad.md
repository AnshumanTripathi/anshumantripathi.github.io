# Choosing the sciences
When I was in high school I was often asked by teachers what I wanted to do when I grew up. Since I never gave an inch of thought about this topic I would say something that my friends used to say like I wanted to be a Doctor or an Engineer or something like that.
As years passed I started to realize that it was time I give a serious thought on what I wanted to be when I grew up. In 10th grade I we realized this we were on a turning point as after the 10th grade we were given a choice of streams like arts, commerce and sciences. This is the first fork in the road every Indian student faces for their careers.
Since my inclination had always been towards science I took the path of choosing the sciences. 

Even with the science there are three options:
1. Physics + Chemistry + Mathematics + Electives (PCM)
2. Physics + Chemistry + Biology + Electives (PCB)
3. Physics + Chemistry + Biology + Mathematics + Electives (PCBM)

To be honest, I was not the top student in my class so #3 was out of the question. I used to get good grades Biology and I could find my way around with Mathematics. I was told by teachers that the Biology track is a difficult one for the career, and it takes years to start a career so the only choice left for me was the PCM route. Until now I never had a serious thought about my future, and I was just going where the tide took me. In the end the road I took was not because I had a plan but more because I thought I can survive this get somehow get passing grades. 
When I looked at my classmates around me, it was a much different picture. It seemed like they had a plan when they took path, and they knew (atleast to some extent) what their future had in store for them which made sometimes made me think if I made a mistake of not thinking about this more seriously.

The point I want to emphasize here is that I was just 15 at that time and everytime someone asked me about what I wanted to do in the future everyone always made me realize that whatever I select now will set my career path in stone. Nobody every told me that you are still young and you can always change switch paths in the future. To an extent they were right for atleast in India, its almost unheard of that somebody took the PCM route and then ended up becoming a doctor or even a commerce student becoming an engineer.
Regardless I ended up on a route to become an engineer of sorts, but I soon realized it had nothing to do with either P, C or M.


# Realizing my calling
Soon after I started with 11th grade I realized that the sciences were really difficult. The only subject I felt with ease was Computer Science, which was an elective subject. This is when I started learning the basics of programming with C and C++. This is when I learned that I was instinctively good programming. This was not a surprise for me. I had always been good at Computers, and it was the one subject where I was the best in class. It might have been because my father had business of selling computers when I was a kid and I used to play with computers from a very young age. It wasn't long before I realized that I could have a future with computer engineering.
The problem having a late realization was that if I wanted to learn computer engineering in a good college, then I would have to take competitive exams like the JEE or AIEEE (now JEE main) which required a good aptitude for PCM subjects which I was not particularly good at. I could easily get a passing grade but excelling in them was a completely different question. 
Not going into a prestigious institution like Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) is out the question in India because the college you graduate to can have a huge impact on what kind of job you end up doing after your undergraduate (bachelors) degree. It was implicitly understood that not going to IITs would make you worthless
After working hard in the 11th grade I somehow got 74% marks (B- grade). This was not nearly enough for getting facing competitive exams like JEE and I had this realization right before I started the 12th grade. I needed to find another way to get a good education computer engineering without going into the IITs.
One day I had an epiphany that I can go out of the country to learn what computer engineering. I started researching on the SAT exam and what doors will that open for me. The more I read about SATs the more confident I got that this was the future I wanted to pursue.

# The SAT
Even though I was confident that I can score well in the SAT exams, I realized there were other problems I overlooked.

## I was not prepared
From my childhood I had always remained at home and in my city. I had never travelled outside alone or lived by myself at all. My parents were not confident that I could travel to a new country and then navigate my way around the new system by myself. Initially I rebelled but after giving a calm thought I realized that they were right.
I did not know anything about cooking or setting up a bank account or taking loans. 

## Undergraduate is expensive
My aim was to go the United States for my education **but the tuition fees for undergraduate a lot**. Taking such a big debt was not a wise decision and would have become a big burden on me and my parents.

# Undergraduate (Bachelors)
I made peace with the decision of not giving the SATs right after my High School and prepare myself to enter into a college within my city. Although at that time it seemed like settling up, **this was the best decision I took**.
The idea was to not give the SATs now but to give GRE after I complete my undergraduate and go to the United States for my Masters. This gave me enough time to explore and learn the skills that I was missing. In my undergraduate classes, I took trainings in programming, robotics and core of computer engineering like algorithms and operating systems. I participated in inter-college programming competitions and even travelled to places like Mumbai, Jaipur, Pilani and Bhopal myself to participate in robotics completions in different college fests.
The lessons I learned here and the friends I made in this time have helped through thick and thin in my life. Once I was nearing the completion of my bachelors degree, I started preparing for GRE.
