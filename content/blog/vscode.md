I have been using IntelliJ (or an Jetbrains editor) for around a decade now and I started to realize that I'm getting used to the some of the issues that I have always had IntelliJ like its execessive resource usage, plugin issues, random crashes its expensive cost for license, etc.

One day a couple of months ago, I was on a call with a colleague and saw he was using VSCode. I had heard that VSCode has gotten much better recently and thought to give it a shot. I setup VSCode and now I have uninstalled IntelliJ entirely. VSCode is not perfect and honestly it can potentially have all the above problems (maybe even more), but that's the beauty of it. VSCode is so configurable that you tune it to your hearts desire.

# Difference between IntelliJ and VSCode
When I was using IntelliJ anytime I would hear the mention of VSCode I would dismiss it because VSCode was a code editor while IntelliJ was an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). To the uninitiated they might seem the same thing, but there is a significant difference. By definition, an IDE has capabilities like programmiing language based auto complete, support for compiling, running and debugging programs. A code editor is an enhanced WYSWYG (What You See is What You Get) editor which supports reading and writing code. 

# Similarities between IntelliJ and VSCode
VSCode started as a code editor while IntelliJ started as an IDE. Now they are both mature tools and can act as both code editors and IDEs. 

- IntelliJ and VSCode have an extensive plugin ecosystem which allows users to extend their capabilities and configure the editors to their needs. 
- IntelliJ and VSCode have command line intergration tools which allows both tools to be used as for quick command line editing.
- IntelliJ and VSCode support compiling, running and debugging code.
